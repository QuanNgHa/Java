/**
 * A positive integer is called a perfect number if the sum of all its proper divisor is equal to its value. 
 * For example, the number 6 is perfect because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 6=1+2+3; 
 * but the number 10 is not perfect because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 5, and 10â‰ 1+2+5. Other perfect numbers are 28, 496, ...
